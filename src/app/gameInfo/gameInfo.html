  <h2>Game Info</h2>
  <div>The player controls Alepha, a junior magician from the Lexicon River Delta. Alepha's magic spells charge when she says the letter of each word aloud in the correct order. The player must input these letters into a textbox using standard keyboard input, at which point the game evaluates the spelling of the word in real time.</div>
  <h3>Gameplay</h3>
  <div>Spelling a word correctly within the time limit will charge the spell one power-level, to a maximum of five. When the time limit expires, or when the maximum power level is reached before time expires, the spell will be fired at the enemy. Misspelling a word breaks Alepha's concentration and allows an enemy to attack. Failing to spell any word within the time limit will also allow an enemy to attack. Alepha can survive five attacks before she runs out of shield power. When Alepha has no more shield power, the game ends.</div>
  <h3>Setting</h3>
  <div>The game is located along the fictional Lexicon River, which runs through a desert. The location is heavily informed by real-world ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian cultures, as these locations are where Western writing systems first originated. The kingdom where Alepha lives is under attack by the cruel and arrogant Lord Zett, who controls half-man, half-crocodile creatures called the Alphagators. Alepha must defeat enough of the Alphagators to be granted a meeting with Lord Zett to challenge him in a final battle. Lord Zett uses his large vocabulary to sound better and smarter than everyone he meets, and has his own word-based spells based on obscure and difficult words from the SAT and SSAT test standards.</div>
